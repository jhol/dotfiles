"""Shared daemon-thread ThreadPoolExecutor.

Stdlib ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` workers are non-daemon AND are registered in
``concurrent.futures.thread._threads_queues``, whose atexit hook
(``_python_exit``) joins every worker unconditionally -- even after
``shutdown(wait=False)``.  A single wedged worker (tool blocked on network
I/O, hung provider daemon, stuck subagent) therefore blocks interpreter
exit forever.  This is the root cause of multi-minute CLI exits on long
sessions: every abandoned concurrent-tool batch leaves workers that the
exit hook insists on joining.

``DaemonThreadPoolExecutor`` spawns daemon workers and skips the
``_threads_queues`` registration, so:

  - ``_python_exit`` never joins them, and
  - the interpreter's non-daemon thread join at shutdown skips them.

Semantics are otherwise identical (initializer/initargs, work queue,
idle-thread reuse).  Use it for any pool whose work is best-effort or
independently interruptible and must never hold the process open:
concurrent tool execution, background memory sync, catalog fan-out,
subagent timeout wrappers.  Do NOT use it for work that must complete
before exit (durable writes) -- those belong on foreground threads with
explicit bounded joins.
